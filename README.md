# Time-keeper-ember

This is an app I'm building on occasionally to track the amount of time spent each day for various categories (sleeping, reading, working out, etc.). I'm using it as a way to learn more about Ember, Rails, Ember Simple Auth, and Chartjs.

This is the Ember portion of this app, the Rails side [is here.](https://github.com/johnmosesman/time-keeper)
